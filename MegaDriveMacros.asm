; Tells the VDP to fill a region of VRAM with a certain byte.
; VRAM fill works like this: the write to the data port happens as normal; that is: 
; * the high byte is written to address^1
; * the low byte is written to address
; Then, the remainder of the fill goes like:
; * the address is incremented by the autoincrement register value
; * high byte of word written to data port is written to address^1
; * repeat until done
; For an even target address, this means:
; * the high byte is written to address+1
; * the low byte is written to address
; * the high byte is written to address (overwrites previous write)
; * the high byte is written to address+3
; * the high byte is written to address+2
; * etc.
; For an odd target address, this means:
; * the high byte is written to address
; * the low byte is written to address+1
; * the high byte is written to address+3
; * the high byte is written to address+2
; * etc.
; This allows reducing the length of the fill by 1.
; It is possible to fill to CRAM and to VSRAM, but it is buggy,
; and not emulated in most emulators.
