# Are the assets yours?
Of course not. *(I wish they were)*  
The font was taken by the awesome Mega Drive C compiler SGDK: https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/blob/master/res/image/font_default.png  
The font asset for the VDP's format was converted using this: https://github.com/Durobot/gimp-megadrive-generate-all-colors  
Additionally, some complier macros were taken from Sonic Retro's Sonic 1 disassembly: https://github.com/sonicretro/s1disasm/blob/AS/MacroSetup.asm  
This repository is where the DMA macros were taken from: https://gist.github.com/flamewing/ac4b8586f74c74fe24fe30e5e0261fb0  

The unused assets were made by me (you can humiliate me)! If only the converter had tile optimization as a feature...
### Can I use this?
Yes, you can, but please just let me know first (you don't have to ask)!

### And how?
In order to build the ROM, you can use my [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/Franklin0770/megaenvironment)

## Can you provide the lore?
With the courtesy of my Systems and Networks teacher, I created in two weeks this presentation **for PAL Mega Drive systems only** (for the taller resolution, useful for showing more content in screen).  
This presentation served as a base to teach my classmates a brief comparison of the x86 architecture and the 68k one, by also illustrating the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000 assembly respectively.

## How did the lesson go?
Extremely well. The explanation was a bit too fast, but an hour of lesson isn't enough (even if it feels decently long). I ended up getting a bonus mark (and a cool sticker with "BRILLIANT" written in it).  
My teacher rightfully never stops laughing when I tell him about my Mega Drive projects, since these personal goals are quite insane and nerdy *(I do Judo and recently got involved in endurance race. I love it so much, don't worry about my health)*.
